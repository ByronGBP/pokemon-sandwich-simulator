a lot of this comes from personal trial-and-error, but I also used others' findings in this thread:
https://old.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/z0k5p2/anyone_know_how_sandwich_ingredients_work/ix94rdf/
so credit to the users in it (New_Log7685, ItzYoboiGuzma, PeddledP)
additional disclaimer that none of this is 100% and there are still a few
	unknowns about how it all works

general rules
================
just a sum of all fillings and condiments
fillings are multiplied by how many on sandwich PHYSICALLY (eg, ham 3, basil 4, rice 1, etc)
+100 to a stat based on flavor bonus table below when comparing top 2 flavors
	if there's only 1 flavor (eg. just a bitter herb, no fillings) then it picks the next unused flavor from the flavor priority list to use as the second
	  flavor to compare the first one to
types are just sorted by sum first, then in-game type sorting (check an herba or in-game pc box type search to see this order)
	then listed with effects in 1, 3, 2 order
	-
	as far as dual/triple typings go
		::assuming [grass, fighting, ghost]::
		main type <= 280: 1, 3, 2 (grass, ghost, fighting)
		main type > 280: 1, 1, 3 (grass, grass, fighting)
		main type > 480: 1, 1, 1 (grass, grass, grass)
	-
	however, if preset MASTER recipe
		::assuming [grass, fighting, ghost]::
		1, 3, 2 (grass, ghost, fighting)
		or 1, 2, first (grass, fighting, normal) 'first' meaning first from priority list
		unsure of reason why (see 'priorities.txt')
	the one exception to the types is preset recipe #39 - Master Dessert Sandwich
		it calculates the type to [flying, ice, steel], but it's actually [flying, poison, fighting]
		for some reason, it's treating the type levels from both apples as if it's just 1 apple,
		  which results in the [flying, poison, fighting] for slots 1 - 3 instead
		i'm gonna call it a bug for now and just hard-code to match the recipe
levels are influenced by the amount of herba you have in sandwich
	1 herba defaults to 2, 2, 1 but can be 2, 2, 2 with enough type points
	2 herba defaults to 3, 3, 3 (this is 3, 3 minimum with no fillings)
	preset sandwich recipes have hard-coded levels
	if you start with a preset sandwich and drop off ingredients, the levels will remain based
	  on preset sandwich, regardless.  this is not shown in the tool.
	it is possible to get >1 levels on non-herba, custom sandwiches
		the level 2 check goes as follows:
			if type amount >= 180, then check power amount
			if power amount >= 100, then make skill level 2
		the level 3 check is:
			if type amount >= 380, then check power amount
			if power amount >= 1000, then make all lines level 3 (until I see a sandwich that isn't all level 3, like [3, 1, 1])
		a few examples:
			rice x6, wasabi x2, curry powder x2 - levels 2, 2, 1
			chorizo x4, rice x2, curry powder x2, wasabi x2 - levels 2, 1, 1
			rice x6, wasabi x2, curry powder x2 - levels 2, 2, 1

miscellaneous
================
putting > 13 of same ingredient on sandwich = 1 star (failure), at least in single player
2 star, low type value sandwiches have a certain threshold that changes the type pattern to [1, 2, 3]
	believe it's if firstType <= 4 AND < 3 pieces on sandwich
	along with some misc stuff..
2 star sandwiches don't add a type when only two exist, making 2 line only sandwiches possible
# of dropped ingredients might influence star level of sandwich
	pretty sure if you drop half+ of ingredients, it becomes a 2 star
	must be more than 1 ingredient, though, so dropping your only rice will keep you 3 stars
		hamburger, ketchup - drop hamburger, you get 3 star sandwich
		basil, ketchup - drop all basil, you get 2 star sandwich
		basil, ketchup - drop 1 basil, you get 3 star sandwich
		2x chorizo, ketchup - drop 3/6 chorizos, you get 2 star sandwich (so it rounds down)
