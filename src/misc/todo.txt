the most obvious next step would be to let users enter criteria such as:
	'normal encounter, dark catch' and then list a few dozen different ingredient combinations to
	achieve the desired sandwich.  I could do this soon, or who knows, someone else could use the data
	from this tool and do it before me
	
distinguish between a custom 'from scratch' sandwich and a modified preset recipe sandwich
	the levels differ between these two, is why
	
x add a text-based loading system, so other users can give each other text strings and load up their custom recipes

x handle loading a multiplayer recipe when in single player mode

x remove alias system and just update jsons to have the preferred aliases
